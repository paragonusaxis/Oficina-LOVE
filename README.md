# Oficina-LOVE
Oficina LÖVE was an online game development workshop taught at UNESP/Brazil in the second semester of 2020. The workshop was aimed at the teaching of core game programming concepts to professional designers, so that they could better implement their own personal projects.

The final project of the workshop was the development of a Pong game, using the game development framework Löve2d.
